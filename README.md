# aperyfractal
Repository for code written to plot what I have dubbed Apéry's discrete fractal.

This is the second version of my program, the first having been written for my dissertation at the University of Bristol.

A discrete fractal is a discrete shape that exhibits fractal-like behaviour (i.e., a repeating selfsame pattern that repeats as you zoom in, but only to a certain point in this case). Apéry's discrete fractal is plotted by constructing the sequence in Brun's criterion with the sequences Apéry used to prove the irrationality of Apéry's constant, &zeta(3).
